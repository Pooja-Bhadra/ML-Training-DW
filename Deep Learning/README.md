# Deep Learning

## Welcome to the PyTorch Deep Learning Models and Operations repository

- Perfomed basic mathematical operations using PyTorch module, gaining a solid foundation in tensor operations and numerical computations.
- Implemented Linear Regression Model and Logistic Regression from scratch using PyTorch's NeuralNet capabilities. This hands-on approach helped in understanding the inner workings of these fundamental models.  
- Designed and Implemented Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model to detect Brain Tumor using images. Did this using PyTorch module. This project demonstrates how to solve real-world problems in medical image analysis.
- Applied Simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurring Units(GRU) and Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) Models to MNIST Dataset.
