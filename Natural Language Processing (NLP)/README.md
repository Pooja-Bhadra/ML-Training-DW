# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

### This GitHub repository demonstrates Natural Language Processing(NLP) Modeling using Python.

- Conducted various text preprocessing tasks by using built-in Python functions and popular libraries like NLTK and re. These tasks included converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, performing stemming and lemmatization.
- Implemented Bag of Words Model and TF-IDF Model for text representation.
- Developed N-Grams model for capturing sequential patterns in the text and generated text using the N-Grams approach.
- Delved into more advanced text embedding models such as Word2Vec and GloVe.
- Performed Sentiment Analysis on textual data and built a predictive model for suggesting next words in a sentence using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Model. All of this work was done in a Google Colab, leveraging TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
